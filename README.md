# ðŸŒ± Daily Wellness Habit Tracker

This is a simple mobile app I built using **React Native + Expo** to help users stay consistent with small daily habits.  
Itâ€™s designed to be light, casual, and fun something that helps without feeling too serious or overwhelming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
I wanted to build something useful and real an app Iâ€™d actually use myself.
This project helped me explore UI/UX thinking, local data handling, and managing a mini Agile process from start to finish.

I care about building things that are:
- Helpful
- Easy to use
- Well-structured and clean under the hood
