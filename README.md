# 🌱 Daily Wellness Habit Tracker

This is a simple wellness app I built using React Native + Expo.  
The goal was to make something that helps track small habits daily without feeling too serious — just something light to encourage consistency.

## Why I Made This:
I wanted to build something practical and meaningful that helps users stay consistent with their daily habits.  
It’s a simple app, but I focused on making it smooth, easy to use, and something I’d actually enjoy using myself.  
I care about building things that are useful, clean, and make sense to real people this app is an example of that.
